# Number Line with Draggable Points

This is my submission for the number line with draggable points project.

## Author

- Author: Manuel Ponce

## Description

This project implements a number line with two draggable points using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can drag the points along the horizontal line, and they will snap to the nearest tick mark. The area between the two points is highlighted with a bold line.

## Bugs

Please note that this implementation has a few known bugs:

1. Currently it does not snap to nearest tick mark. 
2. Overlapping the points cuases the highlighting to bug out. 
3. ...

## Usage

To test the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `number_line.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the draggable points on the number line.
4. Observe the highlighted area between the points.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and fix the existing bugs.
